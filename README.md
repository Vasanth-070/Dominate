# Dominate
This is an 2 player Arcade Game developed using JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS. <br/>
Objective of the game is to reach the target score before player 2 does it. <br/>
Obviously there are some rules need to be followed for a perfect win.<br/>

## How to Play?
<br/>
The game is simple, each player will get a chance to roll the dice.<br/>
If the result of dice is other than **1** then the chance continues. The resultant number is added to current value of the player.<br/>
Now its the player's choice to hold the current and pass the chance to player 2. Or else he can continue with his chance to increase his current holdings.
<br/>
But in the process of increasing the holdings, if the player got **1** in the roll of a dice, all the current holdings will become **0** and also player looses his chance to roll.<br/>
The same procedure applies for player 2 as well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, play wisely, hold your points wisely, and reach the score 100 to win the game.
I wish you a very good luck!!! <br/>
